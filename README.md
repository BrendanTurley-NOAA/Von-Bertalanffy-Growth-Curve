Simple code to fit Von Bertalanffy Growth Curve to data

Download the R code and the two data files and put them into the same directory.

The Von Bertalanffy Growth Curve is a standard growth model typically fit to fish data. The data need to consist of ages and lengths. This example uses age in days and length in mm or cm. I don't know if the units matter (suspect not), however, stay consistent. If you are reading this and know whether the units matter, please contact me through GitHub.
